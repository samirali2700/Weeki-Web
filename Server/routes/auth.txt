     * What to do if signed in?
     * cookie : session
     * since this project is of course not going to be used by many if any 
     * the need to prefer a method over the other is not neccessary
     * but because the site is designed to be for workplaces,
     * and in theory should be used by alot of employees, and could be used by alot at the same time
     * the session method, would not be a good solutions if the session data gets too big
     * and in case of scaling the server, the session would not be able to work together across servers
     * so the best solution in my opinion falls on cookies, no load on the server memory
     * and is very flexisable, and scaling would not effect the already implemented solution
